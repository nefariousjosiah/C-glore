# C++ modified code 
# Inspired off this video i watched in October 2023 https://youtu.be/p09i_hoFdd0?si=YCQVlDdrm0iypy3V


## I was debating putting the source code on github because it was pratically unreadable before, i have since made the code more readable since then.

## This was my longest project so far, which started in February 2024 and took until June 2024 until it was completed.

## As much as i love C++ for it's efficiency and speed, i won't deny making projects on it take extremely longer then for example Javascript or Python.
